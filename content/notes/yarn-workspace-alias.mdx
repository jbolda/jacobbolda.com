# Yarn Workspace Alias

Many of my repositories these days are making use of the `yarn workspace` feature. That is quite a bit of typing for every command though. So I created an alias to `yw` in my `.bashrc` file. This typically resides in your home or user directory.

```bash
alias yw='yarn workspace'
```
