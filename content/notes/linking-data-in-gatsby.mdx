# Linking Data In Gatsby

The possible ways can be generally grouped by if you have some control of the nodes or if they are made for you.

## When Nodes Are Made For You

- [mapping nodes, probably the fastest and most approachable, but requires your data at each node to "match"](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/schema-gql-type/#mapping-field)
- [using `createParentChildLink` typically in the `onCreateNode` lifecycle](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/actions/#createParentChildLink)
  - The `onCreateNode` lifecycle fires every time a new node is created. You can use this to link a node to another node.

## When You Have Control Of The Nodes

- [Setting up the relationship with `___NODE` appended to your node name.](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-creation/#foreign-key-reference-___node)
  - [Also more info at this link](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/schema-gql-type/#foreign-key-reference-___node)
- [A plain value and let Gatsby infer (guess) the type of node (generally for `File` nodes)](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/schema-gql-type/#plain-object-or-value-field)
- [Creating a new type and using a resolver to "manually" query and link them](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/#createResolvers)
  - This is likely the most involved. You will need to use `onCreateNode` to create "linking" nodes.
  - The "linking" nodes will point to your custom type. The type can use the `createResolvers` that let you code the way the node is "inferred".
  - You can see an [example of this in my `gastby-theme-recipes`](https://github.com/jbolda/gatsby-theme-recipes/blob/master/packages/gatsby-theme-recipes/gatsby-node.js).
