Many of my repositories these days are making use of the workspace feature. It started with `yarn`, but recently `npm@^7.7.0` gained support for workspace commands. It is quite a bit of typing for every command though. So I created an alias to `nw` in my `.bashrc` file. This typically resides in your home or user directory.

This function operates in your terminal and accepts args. In the vein of `yarn workspace`, the command expects `nw <package> <command>`. NPM workspaces also allow for an array of (or otherwise multiple packages). This function then lets you enter `nw <command> <package1> <package2> <package3>` for any number of packages that you want to run the command on.

```bash
function nw() {
    if [ "$#" -gt 2 ]; then
        local ws=''
        for arg in $@
        do
            ws="$ws --workspace=$arg"
        done
        npm run-script $1 $ws
    else
        npm run-script $2 --workspace=$1
    fi
}
```

While I was editing it, I figured it made sense to add an alias for `npm run` as well generally for those repositories that aren't workspaces.

```bash
alias nr='npm run'
```

Happy terminal bashing! Let me know on the socials if you have any other nifty helpers in this same vein.
