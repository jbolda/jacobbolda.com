### [Programming, Code and Excel](/gatsby-and-contributing-to-open-source/)

#### Since the '90s

My experience crosses a unique set of languages, but all with the common
goal of solving a specific problem. Programming and code are tools that
have great power when wielded effectively. I consider my primary
languages JavaScript, Python and VBA (see Excel), but I have
additionally worked with Go, QBASIC, Fortran, LISP, SQL,
Bash/Shell/Powershell, PHP, HTML, CSS, and more. More recently my
interest has been in JavaScript, and I have been working on open source
code as expounded upon in the linked article. My overall focus has been
in data, manipulating it, and then visualizing it (see the love for
JavaScript and Python). I am also an expert in Excel and have crafted
some [involved formulas and code under unique constraints](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14614923/excel-formula-identifying-number-of-date-ranges-within-a-range/14616697#14616697) as well as many template spreadsheets still in use at past and present professional engagements.
