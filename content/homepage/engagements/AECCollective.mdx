### [AEC Collective](https://www.aeccollective.com/)
#### A Community Serving the Architectural, Engineering and Construction Industry

I run a community called the AEC Collective. The AEC Collective is a
community for the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction. It uses
the Discord program which is a free voice, video and text chat app that
you can access via PC, browser, or mobile phone. We look to help mentor
those just starting in the industry, and provide a great place for
networking with your peers around the world. We can all benefit from
understanding each related niche better, but also understanding our own
niche outside of our geographic region.
