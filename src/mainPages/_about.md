## Nostaglia Feels Good
I spent my formative years in small town Minnesota before moving to small town Wisconsin. I made my way through high school doing well but never feeling satisfactorily engaged. I want a challenge! I made the leap to college at Milwaukee School of Engineer (MSOE) in ***big city*** Milwaukee, Wisconsin earning my Master's in Structural Engineer, Bachelor's in Architectural Engineering and a minor in management. From there I began to exponentially expand my horizons through learning and travel, both domestic and abroad.

## Stepping Up The Stairs
I was never directly introduced to Entrepreneurship as a life pursuit. The climb began when I read *Rich Dad, Poor Dad*. My neighbor handed me the book, and I never would have guessed the influence on my life path. This little ember started in my high school days. I was hooked. My viewpoint was pretty strictly traditional finance though. The "you can't make money without money" mentality. I spent loads of time learning and understanding what I would need to do after I have money.
