import { Calcs } from "./steel-compression-calcs";

These functions are written in javascript and embedded into
the window. Press F12 (on windows in chrome) to get into the developer
console. Click the console tab, and run c.list() in the console.

`<Calcs />` should run here, but an upstream bug means it
is broken.

<!-- <Calcs /> -->
