#### Thesis Circa 2011

The purpose of my capstone design project report was to discuss the
behavior of a hooked bar in concrete carrying a tension force. The cover
and bonded length were varied to observe the effect on the load
distribution between the hook portion and the bonded length portion of a
hooked bar. Each specimen had 1 or 2 inches of cover. Each specimen had
a bonded length of 8, 12, or 16 inches. Straight rebar was also tested
to provide a control and comparison to the hooked bars with similar
cover and bond length variables. The abstract and full text can be
