# Yarn Global Add Local Package With Windows Path

As much as I dislike global packages, sometimes they have value. This is a slick way to test a local package (even non-published) as a global CLI. Yarn uses the same commands with the addition of the `global` keyword.

```shell
yarn global add package
```

It has a [handful of options](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/add#toc-adding-dependencies) for linking local dependencies. The local symlink version seems handy.

```shell
yarn global add link:/c/Users/Jacob/Documents/dev/tauri/tauri/cli/tauri.js
```

Unfortunately, Windows seems to choke on the colon.

```shell
❯ yarn global add link:/c/Users/Jacob/Documents/dev/tauri/tauri/cli/tauri.js
yarn global v1.22.4
[1/4] Resolving packages...
error Couldn't find package "link;C:\\Users\\Jacob\\Documents\\dev\\tauri\\tauri\\cli\\tauri.js" on the "npm" registry.
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/global for documentation about this command.
```

The only thing I managed to get to work was passing the absolute path without their special options.

```shell
yarn global add /c/Users/Jacob/Documents/dev/tauri/tauri/cli/tauri.js
```

Now typing out the full path is a bit of a chore. Using `$PWD` and running the command from the folder in question, we can shorten it to the following.

```shell
yarn global add $PWD
```

Cheers and have fun testing that CLI!
